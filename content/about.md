Hey there, it's Kamesh Sethupathi. I'm here to take you on a journey through my world of tech, startups, and the invaluable lessons I've learned along the way.

### A Decade of Tech Tales:

Ten years flew by in the blink of an eye. It all began in 2012 when I stumbled upon jQuery. I was fascinated by how it simplified element selection, animations, and Ajax calls. In fact, it was my gateway to the tech world. I remember those nights when I should have been studying for my 10th-grade exams, but I was engrossed in code, building, and creating. Money was not on my radar back then; it was all about the sheer joy of crafting, like playing video games and showing off my creations to friends.

### Why Products Fail: The Hulk Chronicles:

Ever wondered why some products crash and burn? Well, let me share a personal experience. I launched a product named 'Hulk' during my second year of engineering. Hulk was a platform designed to simplify coding. It allowed users to write logic in plain language through Hulk's straightforward syntax, which then generated code in various programming languages like JavaScript, Python, and PHP. I also threw in a learning management system (LMS) to guide students in coding problem-solving and a Hulk IDE for hands-on coding.

Here's where it got interesting. I had a vision, but I skipped the essential step of understanding the market. Instead, I went full steam ahead, building the product, writing documentation, creating a website, and crafting content. This pre-launch phase took three months, three times longer than building the actual product.

And then came the big moment. I thought I'd hit the jackpot with a B2B model, selling in bulk. But reality struck hard. I approached a couple of engineering colleges, expecting them to jump at the opportunity. Instead, they politely laid out why Hulk didn't meet their needs. They wanted their students to get placed, and my product didn't align with that goal. They raised valid points, and it was a wake-up call.

Hulk, my brainchild, had flopped, and I had to face some hard truths. The reasons for its failure were crystal clear:

- Lack of market research.
- Overconfidence in technology, overshadowing the core problem.
- Poor planning and execution (no MVP; I built the entire product at once).
- Unnecessary work (website, documentation).
- Overambitious dreams (thinking I'd be the next Ambani).
- But my journey didn't stop there; it was just a new beginning, and I'll share the rest of that story sometime.

### Product Success Philosophy:

Selling a product isn't just about technology; it's about understanding your target market and tailoring your product to meet their specific needs. It's all about solving their problems, which not only boosts sales but also ensures customer satisfaction.

I firmly believe in prioritizing benefits over features. It's about keeping the focus on your customers and their needs, not just the product or its bells and whistles.

In essence, it's about sales, business, and startups that are driven by customer-centric thinking.

I've got a treasure trove of articles lined up for my personal website. These articles are designed not for the faint-hearted but for those who aspire to be experts in their tech fields. Follow me to stay updated.

### Embracing Failure:

I've had my fair share of product flops along the way. From KodeWall to KodeBoi Hulk, my journey wasn't all smooth sailing. But, as Guru ji Harshad Mehta rightly said, "Failure is the previous chapter of success." So, I'm taking a planned hiatus for the next few years, but don't worry; I'll be back with something exciting. In the meantime, you can explore my past products via these links:
