Hey, I'm [Kamesh Sethupathi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kameshsethupathi/), and I'm here to share my tech journey with you.

### My Tech Story:
Ten years ago, I discovered [PHP](https://www.php.net/), a cool tech thing. It made coding fun. Instead of studying, I was busy building stuff and showing it off to friends.

### Why Products Fail:
I once made a [product](https://www.wrike.com/product-management-guide/software-product/) called 'Hulk.' It was meant to help people [code](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/code) easily. I thought it was great, but I didn't understand what people really needed. I spent a lot of time and effort on it, but it didn't work out. I learned some important lessons.

### Making Products Work:
Selling a [product](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-software-product/) isn't just about technology. It's about understanding what people want and making a product that solves their problems. That's what I believe in.

### Join Me:
I have lots of articles coming up about tech. If you want to learn and become an expert, follow me.

### Learning from Failure:
I've had some products that didn't do well. But as they say, ["Failure is the first step to success."](https://www.clevergirlfinance.com/failure-is-the-first-step-to-success/) I'm taking a break for a while, but I'll be back with something exciting. In the meantime, you can check out my past products.
