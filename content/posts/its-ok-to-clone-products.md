Its ok to copy! Its ok to clone products.

Through out our educational life we were programmed and cultivated into a mindset that copying is bad, copying is the worst thing you could ever do. 

But if we think deeply how we learnt to speak, how we learnt to walk, how we behave, everything we have learnt so far comes from mimicking, seeing and copying others.

We can't build products without knowing how to build a product. To gain that know how, we have to look into the existing product, dig deep into how they work, grasp some idea and try to replicate them. Initially it won't be good, continuous improvement makes them better. 

We don't always have to start from scratch, and it's okay to learn from what others have done before us. By studying and understanding existing products, we can identify opportunities for improvement and create something even better.

Smartphone was not a ground breaking new innovation from scratch, it's an continuous improvement of landline. Smart tvs, smart watches, hypersonic missiles, drones, rifles, slack and countless products were result of copying and continuous improvements.

15 years back everyone were teasing China as a copycat nation, now they are the leaders in technology, they now know the know how of building complex tech products. So we have to get out of the mindset.
