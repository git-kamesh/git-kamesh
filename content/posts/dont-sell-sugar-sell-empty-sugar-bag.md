My father runs a grocery store, and running a grocery store is not as easy as it looks. There are a lot of business tactics and meticulous calculations behind it.

Grocery stores are the most common business you can see nearby, they're everywhere, and so competition is very high.

Sugar, oil, and tomato 🍅. The three killer products in any grocery store which they sell for zero margin. 

These three items are essential for any household, and everyone uses them as a measuring gauge about how much margin a shop places on products they sell. Also, it has loyalty tactics too.

Tomatoes easily get damaged and bring loss since we don't have any margin on them. Then how do we make profit or tally the losses out of them? Simple, "Make profit from the byproducts." We collect and sell empty sugar jute bags and paper cardboard boxes which these products come through as packaging.

These are basically waste, and we make profit from waste, make customers loyal, and make them stay.
