I'm obsessed with developing [products](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-software-product/) which are super easy to use without compromising the ability to achive what's exactly needed for the end user.

Today anyone could build a product, but the ability to [market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketing.asp) and [sell](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/what-is-sales) maters, and it should be naturaly communicated by product itself is what I belive. 

Below is my view on criterias to achive them,

 - Know why you are building, for whom you are building and what you are building

- Embracing [minimalism](https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/minimalism-in-product-design-a-guide-to-simplifying-your-products-dfd0dabd1694) and reducing complexity as much as possible.

- You should fall in love with the design, aesthetics matters.

- Pay attention to details like spacing, alignment, color and typography.

- Focus on adding [illustrations](https://graphicmama.com/blog/what-is-illustration/), animation and interactive elements without disturbing the subtleness.

- 95% > 5%, just to satisfy 5% don't disappoint remaining 95%.

- Product should be extendable and provides ability to [automate](https://www.teamwork.com/blog/task-automation/) things.

- [Embrace community](https://www.zendesk.com/in/blog/community-software) and share knowledge and know-how

- Clear pricing, zero hidden charges, transparent in every incidents and privacy focused.

- Referals, Rewards and Focus on traffic through content.
