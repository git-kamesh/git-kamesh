I'm obsessed with developing products which are super easy to use without compromising the ability to achive what's exactly needed for the end user.

Today anyone could build a product, but the ability to market and sell maters, and it should be naturaly communicated by product itself is what I belive. 

Below is my view on criterias to achive them,

 - Know why you are building, for whom you are building and what you are building

- Embracing minimalism and reducing complexity as much as possible.

- You should fall in love with the design, aesthetics matters.

- Pay attention to details like spacing, alignment, color and typography.

- Focus on adding illustrations, animation and interactive elements without disturbing the subtleness.

- 95% > 5%, just to satisfy 5% don't disappoint remaining 95%.

- Product should be extendable and provides ability to automate things.

- Embrace community and share knowledge and know-how

- Clear pricing, zero hidden charges, transparent in every incidents and privacy focused.

- Referals, Rewards and Focus on traffic theought content.
