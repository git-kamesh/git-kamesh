Today I'm sharing some simple tricks that helped me level up. Remember, these are just ideas to spark your own coding adventure!

### Rock the Basics
- Before you build, you need a strong foundation.
- Master the basic stuff like languages, building blocks (data structures!), and tricks (algorithms!).
- Keep learning and always be up for a challenge.

### Activate Your Business Brain
- Coding is magic, but it's not everything. See how the code connects to the real world.
- Ask, "how does this make money?" Think like a boss, not just a code wizard.

### Clone - Embrace Inspiration
- Ever used a tool you absolutely love? Recreate it!
- Reverse engineer your favorite applications and dissect their inner workings.
- This hands-on approach will level up your coding skills and ignite creativity.

### Deadlines Drive Progress
- Set deadlines for self-projects, hackathons, or online courses
- Deadlines add pressure, focus, and most importantly a sense of accomplishment when you crush them.

### Stay Tuned
- Follow tech blogs, listen to podcasts, and watch tech conferences.
- This will expose you to cutting-edge trends.

### Follow Trend Carefully
- Every new day a new tech trend will arise and something which was on trend yesterday vanishes.
- Give enough time and pick them carefully. Understand whether it truely adds value or not.

### Build Your Name
- Share your code, write blog posts, show off your projects, and build a reputation as a coding master.
- This opens doors to amazing opportunities!

### Break Down The Code
- Take an open-source project and try to understand its architecture, tech stack, data proecessing layers and flows.
- This hands-on exploration will deepen your understanding and help you architect your own project.

### Embrace self-learning
- While courses can be helpful, relying solely on them can create dependency. 
- Struggling through problems on your own, even if it takes longer, builds confidence and problem-solving ability.
