I still remember the surprise and excitement I felt when I read an article about how [Freshworks](https://www.freshworks.com) captured the attention of its competitor's customers through the bold and daring initiative, [#Failsforce](https://www.freshworks.com/events/failsforce-campaign-blog/). It was around 2018 I think, while studying 3rd year of my engineering.


They flew an air balloon with the hashtag **[#Failsforce](https://www.freshworks.com/events/failsforce-blog/)** hashtag, cleverly depicting how bloated [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/) had become and how frustrated some of its customers were.

But the truly daring aspect was doing this at Salesforce's own conference, Dreamforce. That's what makes it such a masterstroke.

While I've read about many captivating marketing campaigns, hashtag **[#Failsforce](https://twitter.com/i/events/1039790905870376961?lang=en)** always pops into my mind whenever I think about marketing because it exemplifies the power of guerrilla marketing.
