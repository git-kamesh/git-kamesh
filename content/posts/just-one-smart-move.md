Believing in something you want to achieve and maintaining that belief despite numerous obstacles and failed attempts means just one thing, you're just a step away from what you want. All it takes is just one smart move to reach it.

It's not a war, it's just a game. We won't lose our lives on failures. Let's try, let's fail, let's learn. Until we stop, there is no end, and we won't stop until we reach our target.

With our collective experience of failures, we can come up with that smart, insightful move that brings us close to our target.

Persistence, coupled with a strategic and thoughtful mindset, can turn dead ends into breakthroughs.
