Large enterprise customers are like gold mines, they bring huge revenue.

But they could also vanish. One unexpected shift in the market, and they could be gone, leaving a huge hole in the revenue.

Thats why Investing in a strong network of small customers acts like a safety net, they adjusts the fluctuations and absorbs shock waves left by large customers when they leave.

These small business customers may not generate massive individual transactions, but their collective strength provides crucial stability.

I belive for any business just like giving priority for enterprise customers, we should treat small businesses they same way.

With this loyal army of small businesses we could face any surprise attacks.
