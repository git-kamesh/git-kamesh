Most developers, especially in their early stages, tend to focus on quick, hacky solutions to get things done. While this approach facilitates learning, it becomes problematic when stuck in this cycle.

The critical issue arises when developers persist in maintaining the same state data in multiple locations. This can lead to various complications:

- **Code Understandability:** Fellow developers may struggle to decipher the logic behind such code.
- **Debugging Challenges:** Debugging becomes difficult as finding the source of issues becomes complicated due to duplicated data.
- **Code Maintenance Difficulty:** Even the original developer may find it challenging to understand their own code days after its creation, hindering efficient maintenance.
- **Lack of Confidence in Modifications:** Fear of introducing errors can undermine a developer's confidence when making changes to the code.
- **Future Use Case Enhancement:** Planning for future use cases becomes challenging when the codebase relies on duplicated data.

To overcome these challenges, developers are encouraged to adopt a best practice: always maintain a single source of truth and avoid duplicating values across multiple states or variables. 

This approach not only promotes code clarity but also facilitates seamless debugging, maintenance, and future enhancements. 

By adhering to this principle, developers can build a strong foundation for their coding journey and ensure the longevity and scalability of their projects.
