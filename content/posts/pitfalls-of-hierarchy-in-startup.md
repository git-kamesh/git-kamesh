Today I could see many startups adding fancy [hierarchies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporate-hierarchy.asp) to their system.

Adding layers of unnecessary hierarchy due to the hype just others doing it will ruin the business rather than benefiting in the longer run.

The more you add the layers of hierarchy, the complex the business is to operate, slowers the phase which the company used to operate and most importantly will change the mindset of people from owning the work to being worked.

For a company there are only two categories of people, the people who creates the product and the people who sells them. Creators and Sellers.

Creating a new hierarchy for a non creator role expecting more value through their expertise is an absolute delusion, we should come to the practicality, you would end up getting inputs which you already know in a jargon garnished way. I would rather spend that money on online ad (which I am not fan of) than for that jargon.

Jargon garnished inputs won't add value to the product but constant regular touch with the end users would. Be passive rather than being active, let customers tell you what they want, if multiple users came with same problem then we can pick and solve it by constantly being touch with them. We don't need an Industry expert to do this right? Even a well trained fresher with decent communication skill could do this.

I belive nurturing Inhouse talents is more important than introducing unnecessary hierarchy. Head count is not the sign of the company size but it's the [profit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_(accounting)). 

Hierarchy is important for smoother operations with well bounded roles and responsibilities, but the same hierarchy should not become a burden.
