Hello! I'm Kamesh Sethupathi, and I'm super excited to welcome you to my own website. I've been a [frontend developer](https://www.coursera.org/articles/front-end-developer) for 5 years, and I've worked with cool companies like [Zoho](https://zoho.com) and [TestSigma](https://testsigma.com). My journey in tech has been fascinating, and I'm eager to share what I've learned with you.

On this site, I'll talk about various stuff, like coding, making cool things, and the world of [startups](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/startup.asp) and businesses. I want to show you what's up in the tech world and maybe inspire you.
